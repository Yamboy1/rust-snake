# Snake (WIP)

A snake game written with Rust and ncurses. Also has a public API for making your own snake game (in Rust).

# Installation

```bash
$ cargo install snake
```

# Using the API

The docs are currently a WIP, however you can try having a look at ./src/bin/snake.rs for an example. Note that this
 is a very low level API for now until we develop a wrapper around it.
